# Bridging the Plant World with API

## Introduction

The "Bridging the Plant World with API" project is an initiative dedicated to promoting environmental sustainability by offering valuable plant information. Simultaneously, it taps into a promising business opportunity by making this information accessible to a wide range of users, including farmers, researchers, florists, plant nurseries, academic communities, and individuals passionate about plants for various purposes, such as ornamental gardening.

The project's main focus is to create an application platform, which serves as a robust platform for accessing comprehensive plant-related data and resources.

## How the Pipeline Works

### Features
This project is committed to providing in-depth information about various plant characteristics, including:

- Plant life cycle
- Watering requirements
- Propagation methods
- Hardiness zones
- Sunlight preferences
- Presence of cones (if applicable)
- Leaf characteristics
- Leaf coloration
- Growth rates
- Care levels

### Data Integration
The data pipeline encompasses the following key steps:

1. **API Download**: Acquiring plant data from external sources via API.
2. **Web Scraping**: Gathering supplementary information by scraping relevant websites.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Rigorous processing and cleansing of the collected data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
4. **Data Frame Merging**: Merging data from various sources to construct comprehensive plant profiles.
